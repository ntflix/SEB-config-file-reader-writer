# Safe Exam Browser config file reader/writer

Use `decrypt_seb.cs`, pointing the `<.seb config file path>` to your .SEB configuration file, and should the configuration file be saved in the correct format, this program will attempt to decode it and write out a new file of `<.seb config file path>.new.seb` of the plaintext, unencoded version of the same configuration file.

This configuration file may be edited to configure your exam settings.

This repository was created as a tool to assess and demonstrate the security posture of Safe Exam Browser against a motivated cheating examinee.
